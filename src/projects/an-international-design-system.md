  Parametric searches are typically a mess of cluttered interface components and
  unreadable data. I created a solution for Panasonic America that strips away
  the complexity and provides users with an easy way to configure and refine the
  parameters of their search.

This solution required an in-depth understanding of not only the data but of how users consumed it. During early user research one of the major pain points highlighted was the lack of connection between the filter settings and results table. To solve this I combined the filters and results table using a drawer mechanism to hide and show the filter options. This drawer, along with the filter headers, follow the user down the page always allowing them the opportunity to tweak and refine their search no matter how far they have scrolled.

Another challenge for this project was creating a solution that worked across all device sizes. On mobile screens the interface can be crowded and their isn't enough space for the product number to sit on the left of the table. To solve this I repositioned the product number above the filter values and had it scroll beneath with the filter header. This created an easy to read structure with the typography forming the columns.

This solution has tested well since it's launch and been widely accepted as a major improvement on exisiting parametric searches by both the client and their user base.
