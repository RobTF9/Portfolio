We began by conducting usability tests on the current RAC journey as well as major competitors. This helped us to identify not only where the RAC could improve but how the industry as a whole was failing itâ€™s customers. A lack of understanding and logical flows were identified as the key flaws with most breakdown cover payment journeys. We rapidly prototyped and guerilla tested what we considered were viable solutions, this sparked the idea of conversational flow using either questions or statements to guide the user through the journey.

The structure of the rest of the project was to work on two options for a week and then conduct a day of testing on the Friday. The team consisted of myself, one UI designer, one developer, two UX consultants and the technical lead. My role was to style the prototype with SCSS and introduce interactive elements with JavaScript all the while contributing to the UI design. This hands on approach meant we were essentially designing with code, it allowed us to tweak continually whilst letting the developer focus on the data and pricing model.

After the first two weeks of testing we were seeing particularly good results with the questions route, people were able to fully list the details of the insurance products they had just purchased and we encountered very few usability issues. To view the project visit the RAC site and take a look at the breakdown cover payment journey. When the journey went live, not only did it meet IDD regulations but it also significantly outperformed the previous iteration. I was personally thanked by Dave Hobday CEO of the RAC for my contributions on this project.

As I mentioned the breakdown cover journey is on the RAC site. However, the prototype I worked on is still active and can be viewed <a href="http://rac-idd.herokuapp.com/option-d-2a?paymentFrequency=1">here.</a>
