<p class="title">The solution</p>

<div class="content">

I started by using google analytics to get an idea of how people were using the website. One thing stood out to me; people were engaging with content on large screens but on mobile and small tablets they were immediately bouncing from article pages. After taking a look myself I realised that a lot of the article headlines on mobile were taking up most of the page, making the reading experience on smaller screens incredibly awkward. All though this seemed like a relatively minor detail, introducing a responsive type system would be key to delivering a pleasant reading experience across all devices.

The way the responsive type system works is to have a consistent body copy size across all devices and scale the the headers proportional to the resolution. This means a H1 on mobile would be much smaller than on desktop, whereas H5 would reduce less. This gives more striking contrast on larger screens where there is enough space to do so, but a more compact, refined reading experience on mobile. I presented my ideas back to the client and they were impressed with not only the thought that had gone into it but also could clearly see how such a small detail could have a big impact on the usability of the site.

The type system was delivered as part of an atomic pattern library for Osborne Clarkeâ€™s digital products. As well as creating the type system I audited the whole site, an issue with the previous implementation was the number of unique patterns. When adding a new feature, section or microsite Osborne Clarke would usually start from scratch and create something that had very little in common, visually, with the rest of the site. I documented all the unique patterns that had the same function and visualised how the site would look if we introduced an atomic pattern library approach. Although this process will not be completed overnight the site is currently being brought in line with my atomic design system and is already looking more consistent.
